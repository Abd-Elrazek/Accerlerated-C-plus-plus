#Exercises

4-0. Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.

4-1. We noted in ยง4.2.3/65 that it is essential that the argument types in a call to max match exactly. Will the following code work? If there is a problem, how would you fix it?
```
int maxlen;
Student_info s;
max(s.name.size(), maxlen);
```
4-2. Write a program to calculate the squares of int values up to 100. The program should write two columns: The first lists the value; the second contains the square of that value. Use setw (described above) to manage the output so that the values line up in columns.

4-3. What happens if we rewrite the previous program to allow values up to but not including 1000 but neglect to change the arguments to setw? Rewrite the program to be more robust in the face of changes that allow i to grow without adjusting the setw arguments.

4-4. Now change your squares program to use double values instead of ints. Use manipulators to manage the output so that the values line up in columns.

4-5. Write a function that reads words from an input stream and stores them in a vector. Use that function both to write programs that count the number of words in the input, and to count how many times each word occurred.

4-6. Rewrite the Student_info structure to calculate the grades immediately and store only the final grade.

4-7. Write a program to calculate the average of the numbers stored in a vector<double>.

4-8. If the following code is legal, what can we infer about the return type of f?
```
double d = f()[n];
```
