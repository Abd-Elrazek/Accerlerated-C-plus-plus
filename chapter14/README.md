Exercises
14-0. Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.

14-1. Implement the comparison operation that operates on Ptr<Core>.

14-2. Implement and test the student grading program using Ptr<Core> objects.

14-3. Implement the Student_info class to use the final version of Ptr, and use that version to implement the grading program from ยง13.5/247.

14-4. Reimplement the Str class to use the final version of Ptr.

14-5. Test the reimplemented Str class by recompiling and rerunning programs that use Str, such as the version of split and the picture operations that use a Vec<Str>.

14-6. The Ptr class really solves two problems: maintaining reference counts, and allocating and deallocating objects. Define a class that does reference counting and nothing else; then use that class to reimplement the Ptr class.
