###Recommended
>This is a very classic c + + books.Liu Weipeng gave a highly evaluation to this book in his CSDN blog (http://blog.csdn.net/pongba/article/details/1930150). Liu Weipeng,a senior engineer in Microsoft at silicon valley,also write an artical about an interview with Bjarne Stroustrup is the designer and original implementer of C++ and the author of "The C++ Programming Language" and “The Design and Evolution of C++”.And the site of this artical is: http://blog.csdn.net/pongba/article/details/2034207.

###My Purpose
<p>We can find all other CS blogs or CS BBS are all recommend 《Accerlerated C++》 as the C++'s most classic books.But most people, who read this book may put their eyes in the formal konwledge but ignore the exercises.Even their realize the importance of these exercises but some maybe a little difficult or although they accomplished it they also want to konw whether it it true or not.Unfortunately this book hasn't publish a book   so I just such a thought, the use spare time to practice after class code again and try to give a full answer and posted all code, for your reference learning.But because of the level of personal ability is limited, gives the solution may not be optimal, so also welcome to comment.
