#Exercises

11-0. Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.

11-1. The Student_info structure that we defined in Chapter 9 did not define a copy constructor, assignment operator, or destructor. Why not?

11-2. That structure did define a default constructor. Why?

11-3. What does the synthesized assignment operator for Student_info objects do?

11-4. How many members does the synthesized Student_info destructor destroy?

11-5. Instrument the Student_info class to count how often objects are created, copied, assigned, and destroyed. Use this instrumented class to execute the student record programs from Chapter 6. Using the instrumented Student_info class will let you see how many copies the library algorithms are doing. Comparing the number of copies will let you estimate what proportion of the cost differences we saw are accounted for by the use of each library class. Do this instrumentation and analysis.

11-6. Add an operation to remove an element from a Vec and another to empty the entire Vec. These should behave analogously to the erase and clear operations on vectors.

11-7. Once you've added erase and clear to Vec, you can use that class instead of vector in most of the earlier programs in this book. Rewrite the Student_info programs from Chapter 9 and the programs that work with character pictures from Chapter 5 to use Vecs instead of vectors.

11-8. Write a simplified version of the standard list class and its associated iterator.

11-9. The grow function in ยง11.5.1/208 doubles the amount of memory each time it needs more. Estimate the efficiency gains of this strategy. Once you've predicted how much of a difference it makes, change the grow function appropriately and measure the difference.
